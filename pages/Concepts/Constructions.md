Here we list some general constructions of fusion rings/categories and their properties.

# Group Rings of Finite Groups

The group ring of any finite group $G$ is a fusion ring. For such rings:
* all objects are invertible and have [quantum dimension]({% link pages/Concepts/FrobeniusPerronDimension.md %}) equal to $1$,
* the rank is the order of the group.

Every group ring is categorifiable to a fusion category, whose $F$-symbols correspond to $3$-cocycles.
$G$ is Abelian iff all its categorifications admit a braiding.

# $\text{Rep}(G)$

The irreducible representations of any finite group with the tensor product as ring product form a fusion ring.

# Fusion Rings Coming From Lie Theory

# $\text{SU}(2)_k$

Properties:

* quantum dimensions: $2\cos{\frac{\pi}{k+2}}$
