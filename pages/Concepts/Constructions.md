Here we list some general constructions of fusion rings/categories and their properties.

## Group Rings of Finite Groups

Properties: 

* all objects are invertible
* the rank is the order of the group
* quantum dimensions: 1

## $$\text{Rep}(G)$$

## The Quantum Double

## $$\text{SU}(2)_k$$

Properties: 

* quantum dimensions: 2\cos{\frac{\pi}{k+2}}

## Tambara-Yamagami 

## Haagerup-Izumi

## Quadratic Categories

## Songs
