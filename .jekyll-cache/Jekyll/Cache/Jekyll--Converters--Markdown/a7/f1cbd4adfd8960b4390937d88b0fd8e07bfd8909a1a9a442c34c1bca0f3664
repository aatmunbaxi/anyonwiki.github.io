<p class="definition*"><strong class="label">Definition</strong>
  Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\).  A <em>left coset</em>
  of \(H\) in \(G\) is a subset of \(G\) that is of the form \(xH\),
  where \(x \in G\) and \(xH = \{ xh : h \in H \}\).
  Similarly a <em>right coset</em> of \(H\) in \(G\) is a subset
  of \(G\) that is of the form \(Hx\), where
  \(Hx = \{ hx : h \in H \}\)</p>

<p>Note that a subgroup \(H\) of a group \(G\) is itself a
left coset of \(H\) in \(G\).</p>

<p class="lemma"><strong class="label" id="LeftCosetsDisjoint">Lemma</strong>
  Let \(H\) be a subgroup of a group \(G\), and let \(x\) and \(y\) be
  elements of \(G\).  Suppose that \(xH \cap yH\) is non-empty.
  Then \(xH = yH\).</p>

<p class="proof"><strong class="label">Proof</strong>
  Let \(z\) be some element of \(xH \cap yH\).  Then \(z = xa\)
  for some \(a \in H\), and \(z = yb\) for some \(b \in H\).
  If \(h\) is any element of \(H\) then \(ah \in H\) and
  \(a^{-1}h \in H\), since \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\).
  But \(zh = x(ah)\) and \(xh = z(a^{-1}h)\) for all \(h \in H\).
  Therefore \(zH \subset xH\) and \(xH \subset zH\), and thus
  \(xH = zH\).  Similarly \(yH = zH\), and thus \(xH = yH\),
  as required.</p>

<p class="lemma"><strong class="label" id="SizeOfLeftCoset">Lemma</strong>
  Let \(H\) be a finite subgroup of a group \(G\).  Then each left
  coset of \(H\) in \(G\) has the same number of elements as \(H\).</p>

<p class="proof"><strong class="label">Proof</strong>
  Let \(H = \{ h_1, h_2,\ldots, h_m\}\), where
  \(h_1, h_2,\ldots, h_m\) are distinct, and let \(x\) be an
  element of \(G\).  Then the left coset \(xH\) consists of
  the elements \(x h_j\) for \(j = 1,2,\ldots,m\).
  Suppose that \(j\) and \(k\) are integers between
  \(1\) and \(m\) for which \(x h_j = x h_k\).  Then
  \(h_j = x^{-1} (x h_j) = x^{-1} (x h_k) = h_k\),
  and thus \(j = k\), since \(h_1, h_2,\ldots, h_m\)
  are distinct.  It follows that the elements
  \(x h_1, x h_2,\ldots, x h_m\) are distinct.
  We conclude that the subgroup \(H\) and the left
  coset \(xH\) both have \(m\) elements,
  as required.</p>

<p class="theorem"><strong class="label" id="Lagrange">Theorem</strong>
<em><strong>(Lagrangeâ€™s Theorem)</strong></em>
  Let \(G\) be a finite group, and let \(H\) be a subgroup
  of \(G\).  Then the order of \(H\) divides the order of \(G\).</p>

<p class="proof"><strong class="label">Proof</strong>
  Each element \(x\) of \(G\) belongs to at least one left coset
  of \(H\) in \(G\) (namely the coset \(xH\)), and no element
  can belong to two distinct left cosets of \(H\) in \(G\)
  (see <a href="#LeftCosetsDisjoint">Lemma</a>).  Therefore every
  element of \(G\) belongs to exactly one left coset of \(H\).
  Moreover each left coset of \(H\) contains \(|H|\) elements
  (see <a href="#SizeOfLeftCoset">Lemma</a>).  Therefore \(|G| = n |H|\),
  where \(n\) is the number of left cosets of \(H\) in \(G\).
  The result follows.</p>
