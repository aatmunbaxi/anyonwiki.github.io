The website is styled using the "Proof" style files. Some remnants of this style (such as the "manual" page in the side bar) still remain but will disappear later on. Below is the README of the stylefile:

Proof
=====

Proof is a minimal Jekyll theme for mathematicians based on [Ed](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/), which is in turn based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). Ed is focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility, hence it is a perfect ground field for building a theme for collaborating and documenting mathematics.

To learn how to install and begin using Proof, visit Ed's [documentation](http://minicomp.github.io/ed/documentation).
